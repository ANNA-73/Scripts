## pair_matching.sh 
This script is give an idea how to pair files when we have a lot of samples in a directory and we need to run them as pairs.For instance when you have paied-end FASTQ files 
that need assembly. instead of writing the names of the pairs in the quest job script, we can include this pair-matching script.
